# NostrPress

## About Nostr

Nostr (Notes and Other Stuff Transmitted by Relays) is an open protocol for decentralized social apps. It aims to replace chat, microblogging, and full blogging with a simple, interoperable spec.

## What is NostrPress?

Generate a modern static blog from your Nostr long-form posts (kind 30023).

### Why

Blogs on Nostr are great, but they have drawbacks:
- Discoverability is limited to relay coverage and client UX.
- SEO is weak compared to traditional sites.
- Media hosting can be unreliable or fragmented.
- Long-term archiving depends on relay retention policies.

Since Medium is not great and is full of ads, the best option is to self-host your blog. The problem: you have to manage hosting, themes, SEO, RSS, media, and deployment.

So we built NostrPress. It takes your blogs (also called articles) from Nostr and builds a static blog from them. That means you get your content in two places: on the Nostr network and on a SEO-optimized, full static website.
